### 👋 Hi there, My name is Nojdar.

I am a web developer and passionate about creating engaging and user-friendly experiences on the web. Currently, I am studying at HackYourFuture, where I have been improving my skills and expanding my knowledge in various web technologies.

Here's a glimpse of what I've learned during my HackYourFuture journey so far:
- 💻 JavaScript: I have a good understanding of JavaScript and its core concepts. I can confidently build interactive and dynamic web applications using this programming language.
- 🎨 CSS: I am fairly good at crafting nice and responsive user interfaces with CSS.
- 🌐 HTML: I have a strong foundation in HTML and understand the importance of writing clean and semantic markup for better accessibility.
- ⚛️ React: I have experience in building modular and scalable web applications using this popular JavaScript library.
- 🌐 Backend Development: While my main focus has been on front-end development, I have also gained familiarity with the backend side of web development.

I am incredibly excited and motivated to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in web development. I enjoy working on challenging projects and finding creative solutions to problems.

You can reach me at nojdar.issa7@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nojdar/).
